### Current handoff

- Worktree: `/Users/edwintse/Documents/aeep-toolkit-v2`.
- Source baseline and GitHub main: `8b015bf0247d4d9f49038982c49f3711a2802d97`.
- Imported all nine toolkit documents from the supplied archive; see bundle digest in `reports/toolkit-v2/c00/workspace.json`.
- Inventory and import map written. Original checkout edits remain untouched.
- Initial managed-worktree tests failed because executable identity inspection refuses `.codex` state. Full logs remain under `reports/toolkit-v2/c00/location-failure`. Never weaken that guard for this task.
- Baseline commands are running in the replacement worktree; inspect `checks.json` and log tails before repeating them.
- Read-only upstream research is under `reports/toolkit-v2/c01`. No third-party code installed or executed.
- No live trial, grant amendment, credentials, payment, publication or host configuration change authorized by these records.
